## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [What do you name color variables?](https://css-tricks.com/what-do-you-name-color-variables/) - I like using variables but up until now I wasn't always using the same naming-convention. I looked it up on CSS Tricks and came across a link to [Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html#color-theme-creation) where the same naming-convention is being used like I was aiming for. Bookmarked the site thus.
